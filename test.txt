things to know about git

git is a local repo

github is a repo online which can be viewd by everyone who you give acess to or make the repo public

first changes have to made in local ie.. git and then pushed to online repo iee. git hub

in vs code you can view the files changes which have been made or in cmd you can type git status
as you can see git status gives two new files .gitignore and test.txt which have been addded to repo

every git repo has a staging area and git status gives you status of staging area
to add items to staging area you can do git add . to add all files or git add test.txt to add single files

now if you notice the files have been added to staging area and hence color changed ot green
 i did not save test.txt see what happens after is save it so u will be notified when i make changes?
 not yet, this is your local repo let me show you how to first commit and then push code to server where i can view

 once all required files are in the staging area you have to commit the code.
 you can do it by using git commit -m "message of commit"ok

 please type your github email that we created last time ee. your gmail account


 now lets push your code to server. if you notice all your repo is empty
 testo push we use the command git push origin main (we wil discuss branches later) remember main"
